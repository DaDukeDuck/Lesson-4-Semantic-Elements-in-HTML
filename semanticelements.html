                    <h2> Reason why ketchup is better than mustard</h2>
                    <p>
                        For one, Ketchup has a more exquisite taste than that of mustard which tastes more bland.
                         For another, Ketchup is also the color red which is subjectively better than the color yellow.
                          I belive that my point has been proven.

                    <p>
                        I do not have nothing to write about right now because the ketchup and mustard idea
                        was all that I could imagine on the spot and I cannot imagine anything else that I can 
                        think of right now.
